# Back-Pain-Monitor

Back pain is a problem for many people and it’s hard to record back pain. Back pain is one of the most common injuries that is highly reoccurring and cannot easily be treated. If not treated correctly, the pain can become chronic and even disabling. Due to the nature of back pain’s random occurrences, someone might have trouble keeping track of their pain for their own records and for communicating with their doctor so that the person can describe what is happening and the doctor can provide adequate treatment. The record of pain can be highly useful to the doctor who can analyze the records and help you treat the pain. 

The app will allow a person to record when their back hurts, where in the back it hurts, a level of pain severity, type of pain, duration of pain, and notes for what they were doing when they experienced the pain. The person will be able to view individual logs of their pain experience (and edit and delete if needed). The person will be able to see when they had back pain so they can see patterns over time. They can see patterns according to other features (e.g., what type of pain they most frequently experience). Furthermore, they will be able to generate reports that summarize key information so that they can communicate with their doctor. They can also send their logs and reports to their doctor. The app will be developed in Ionic and Angular, and the database will be a Firestore database.
